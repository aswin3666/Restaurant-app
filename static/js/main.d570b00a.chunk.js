Headley and his crew turn seasonal vegetables into delectable salads and riffs on American comfort food favorites. The specials menu changes daily, and the rest of the menu is constantly evolving. You can get a lot of food to eat here for under $15 per person."},{"name":"Gabriel","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":5,"comments":"I was turned on to this place following the glowing NYT review. Its near my area of the city so I figured why not go? Man they weren\'t kidding, Superiority Burger is probably the best vegetarian experience I\'ve ever had!"},{"name":"Shivi","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":4,"comments":"Great flavors and very satisfying. Craving a sandwich, I stopped by on a Friday night with a vegetarian friend. Super small location with just a few seats inside. Ambiance is a bit industrial, good is definitely much more sophisticated than the look of the place! Ordered the superiority burger anda side of potato salad. The potato salad was very light and tasted clean ( less mayo, lots of dill and some cucumber) -- refreshing for a humid summer night! Sandwich was surprisingly delicious - it is very small ( funny allusion to a White Castle burger) but it packs a punch! Not only are there layers of flavors ( amazing sauces) but the party itself had a great texture Ahmed flavor-- well done and so wonderful! Will definitely stop by again for an overall amazing burger/sandwich. Staff was super nice and accommodating but not out of the way friendly."}]},{"id":8,"name":"The Dutch","neighborhood":"Manhattan","photograph":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1584362066939-5982187ab049?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8MTEyfHxyZXN0YXVyYW50fGVufDB8fDB8fA%3D%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=500&q=60","address":"131 Sullivan St, New York, NY 10012","latlng":{"lat":40.726584,"lng":-74.002082},"cuisine_type":"American","operating_hours":{"Monday":"11:30 am - 3:00 pm, 5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Tuesday":"11:30 am - 3:00 pm, 5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Wednesday":"11:30 am - 3:00 pm, 5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Thursday":"11:30 am - 3:00 pm, 5:30 pm - 11:00 pm","Friday":"11:30 am - 3:00 pm, 5:30 pm - 11:30 pm","Saturday":"10:00 am - 3:00 pm, 5:30 pm - 11:30 pm","Sunday":"10:00 am - 3:00 pm, 5:30 pm - 11:00 pm"},"reviews":[{"name":"Steve","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":4,"comments":"Over the last five years, The Dutch has turned into the quintessential American restaurant that chef Andrew Carmellini and partners Josh Pickard and Luke Ostrom sought to evoke when it first opened.

It was all delicious and well put together. Would love to eat here again."},{"name":"Lori","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":4,"comments":"Aside from the slightly claustrophobic dining area and the fact that you may have difficulty hearing your dining companion, I\'d return to The Dutch without hesitation. The food is surprisingly well-executed and conceived, and our dinner service flowed smoothly without a hitch. Just make sure to get a reservation in advance, as I\'m sure more than just a few other people will have the same idea."}]},{"id":9,"name":"Mu Ramen","neighborhood":"Queens","photograph":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582301217431-c5f83dfd8ec7?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80","address":"1209 Jackson Ave, Queens, NY 11101","latlng":{"lat":40.743797,"lng":-73.950652},"cuisine_type":"Asian","operating_hours":{"Monday":"5:00 pm - 10:00 pm","Tuesday":"5:00 pm - 10:00 pm","Wednesday":"5:00 pm - 10:00 pm","Thursday":"5:00 pm - 10:00 pm","Friday":"5:00 pm - 11:00 pm","Saturday":"5:00 pm - 11:00 pm","Sunday":"5:00 pm - 10:00 pm"},"reviews":[{"name":"Steve","date":"October 26, 2016","rating":4,"comments":"Joshua Smookler\u2019s two-year-old ramen shop serves one of the best tonkotsu broths around.

Started with a strawberry margarita which was good in flavor but not much alcohol. Had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and it was really good. Great balance in flavor and a good portion. Extra tasty with their hot sauces. My wife had the lamb but it was a bit too salty for our taste. Although, it was cooked very well and fell off the bone. The highlight of the night was the tres leches cake. Probably the best I\'ve ever had to be honest. Not too sweet and very milky. Overall, one of my top 3 favorite Mexican in NY."}]}]}')},85:function(e,a,t){},86:function(e,a,t){},94:function(e,a,t){},96:function(e,a,t){},97:function(e,a,t){},98:function(e,a,t){},99:function(e,a,t){}},[[100,1,2]]]);
